	trials when each provides results on more than one outcome per patient and these 
	multiple outcomes are correlated. That fixed-effects generalized-least-squares 
	approach analyzes the multiple outcomes jointly within a single model, and it 
	can include covariates, such as duration of therapy or quality of trial, that 
	may explain observed heterogeneity of results among the trials. Sometimes the 
	covariates explain all the heterogeneity, and the fixed-effects regression model 
	is appropriate. However, unexplained heterogeneity may often remain, even after 
	taking into account known or suspected covariates. Because fixed-effects models 
	do not make allowance for this remaining unexplained heterogeneity, the 
	potential exists for bias in estimated coefficients, standard errors and p-
	values. We propose two random-effects approaches for the regression meta-
	analysis of multiple correlated outcomes. We compare their use with fixed-
	effects models and with separate-outcomes models in a meta-analysis of 
	periodontal clinical trials. A simulation study shows the advantages of the 
	random-effects approach. These methods also facilitate meta-analysis of trials 
	that compare more than two treatments.},

	been some change of focus from a single response to the analysis of multiple

	meta-analysis models: two multivariate analogues of the traditional univariate 
	random effects models which make different assumptions about the relationships 
	between studies and estimates, and a multivariate random effects model which is 
	a Bayesian adaptation of the mixed model approach. Our preferred method is then 
	illustrated through an analysis of a new data set on parental smoking and two

		comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment for periodontal disease. The 
		specific procedures considered were the modified Widman flap compared with 
		scaling and root planning or curettage with anesthesia. We chose the most 
		consistently reported outcomes, pocket depth and attachment level, for 
		analysis. At 1 year of follow-up, surgical treatment reduced pocket depth more 
		than non-surgical for all initial levels of disease, but by 5 years, only the 
		deepest initial pockets (> 7 mm) showed significant improvement over non-
		surgically treated teeth (0.51 mm reduction, p < 0.01). Attachment level 
		showed significantly better early results for non-surgical treatment for less 
		diseased teeth, but by 5 years, all significant differences had disappeared. 
		We computed quality scores following a method described by Chalmers. The mean 
		quality score for study data analysis and presentation was 0.37 +/- 0.009 and 
		for the study protocol, the mean quality score was 0.19 +/- 0.002. We find 
		that this meta-analysis supports findings relating response to therapy with 
		initial level of disease severity. We also find that the choice of outcome 
		measure influences the choice of therapy, with surgical therapy providing 
		greater benefit for probing depth and non-surgical therapy providing greater 
		benefit for attachment level. These results must be viewed, however, in light 
		of the low quality scores of the evaluated studies and the potential for bias 
		due to lack of binding, the small mean treatment differences, and the observer 
		measurement variability.},

		The multivariate random effects model is a generalization of the standard 
		univariate model. Multivariate meta-analysis is becoming more commonly used and 
		the techniques and related computer software, although continually under 
		development, are now in place. In order to raise awareness of the multivariate 
		methods, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages, we organized a one day 
		"Multivariate meta-analysis" event at the Royal Statistical Society. In addition 
		to disseminating the most recent developments, we also received an abundance of 
		comments, concerns, insights, critiques and encouragement. This article provides 
		a balanced account of the day's discourse. By giving others the opportunity to 
		respond to our assessment, we hope to ensure that the various view points and 
		opinions are aired before multivariate meta-analysis simply becomes another 
		widely used de facto method without any proper consideration of it by the 
		medical statistics community. We describe the areas of application that 
		multivariate meta-analysis has found, the methods available, the difficulties 
		typically encountered and the arguments for and against the multivariate 
		methods, using four representative but contrasting examples. We conclude that 
		the multivariate methods can be useful, and in particular can provide estimates 
		with better statistical properties, but also that these benefits come at the 
		price of making more assumptions which do not result in better inference in 
		every case. Although there is evidence that multivariate meta-analysis has 
		considerable potential, it must be even more carefully applied than its 
		univariate counterpart in practice.},
